# Add Tests

### Step 1: Download Tests from GitHub

Download all tests needed from GitHub. There should be 3 files for each test( .ps1, .tests.ps1, .md )

### Step 2: Copy to your `Custom` folder

Copy the test files into the `Custom` folder.

#### Step 3: Run the tests

Now when you run your custom tests folder this test should show

### Step 4: Customize to your company

For all files, run the Find and Replace in VSCode for "Contoso" with your company name. I have this as the last step to ensure the test works correctly in your enviroment before changing the name.
