Added a new test for US users where it tests if the State attribute has a valid 2 letter abbreviation without periods value. If it doesn't, it will fail the test.

**Test:** ENTRA.UF.1004.T01.USState

What other tests are you looking for? Would you prefer these updates just in the changelog, or would you prefer both?


Have a great day!
