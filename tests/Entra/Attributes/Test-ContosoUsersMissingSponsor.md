This test checks if there are any users without a sponsor assigned.

Contoso's company policy requires that all users have a designated sponsor. This helps provide guidance and oversight within the organization.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a sponsor.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Sponsor Missing - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/sponsormissing) to request the sponsor assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - ðŸ”º If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
