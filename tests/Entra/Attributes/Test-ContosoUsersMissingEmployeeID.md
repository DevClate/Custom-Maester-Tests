This test checks if there are any users without an employee ID assigned.

Contoso's company policy requires that all users have an employee ID. This is fundamental for internal administration and payroll.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without an employee ID.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Employee ID Missing - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/employeeidmissing) to request the employee ID assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - ðŸ”º If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
