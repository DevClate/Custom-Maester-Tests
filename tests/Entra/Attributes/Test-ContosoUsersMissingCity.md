This test checks if there are any users without a city assigned.

Contoso's company policy requires all users to have a city assigned. This helps in localizing resources and tax allocations.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a city.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: City Missing - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/citymissing) to request the city assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - ðŸ”º If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
