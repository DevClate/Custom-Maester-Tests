This test checks if there are any users without a fax number assigned.

Contoso's company policy requires that all users maintain a fax number for legacy systems. This is still needed for certain business processes.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a fax number.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Fax Number Missing - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/faxnumbermissing) to request the fax number assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - ðŸ”º If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
