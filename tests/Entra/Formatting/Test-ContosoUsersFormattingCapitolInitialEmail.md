This test checks if the email address local part uses a capital first initial, followed by the last name with only its first letter capitalized.

Contoso requires all users to follow this format for consistency:  
• First character of the given name in uppercase  
• Surname with its first character in uppercase, and the rest in lowercase  
• Example: JSmith@contoso.com

To remediate:  
• Identify users whose email addresses do not match this format  
• Raise a ticket in Service Now to correct the email format
