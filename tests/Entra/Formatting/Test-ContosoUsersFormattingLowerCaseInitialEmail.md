This test checks if user email addresses follow the policy of using a lowercase first initial plus last name (e.g., jsmith).

Contoso's company policy requires that all users have a valid email format assigned. This is important for consistent branding and correspondence.

**To remediate this issue:**
- Identify users with an invalid or missing email format.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Invalid or Missing Email Format - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/emailmissing) to request the correct email format assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - ðŸ”º If not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
