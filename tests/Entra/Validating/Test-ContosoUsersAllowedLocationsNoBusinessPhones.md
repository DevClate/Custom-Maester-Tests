This test checks if users have all six location properties: streetAddress, city, state, postalCode, country, and companyName matching an allowed record. The businessPhones attribute is excluded.

Contoso's company policy now requires that every userâ€™s location be complete and accurate without considering businessPhones.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify any user with nearly correct location information.
- Submit a correction request through [Form: Invalid or Incomplete Location - HR Ticket](https://contoso.service-now.com/invalidlocation).
  - ðŸ”º If no action occurs within three days, escalate to HR.
